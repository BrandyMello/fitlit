### Contributor comments
<em><small>I really enjoyed this project. It was a challenge, but I learned much more from this project than from any of other project at Turing. I would like to go back and take some time to work on it further. It was a simulation of a current useful and viable application on the market today and I appreciated working on a relevant product. -Brandy Mello</small></em>

<em><small>Challenging but rewarding. With this project we came to the understanding on how to write better tests. As well as see how much easier it was to build the project with already tested code. -Amanda Sierra Lopez</small></em>


## Objectives

This Turing Mod 2 paired project was designed for students to utilize and practice skills in writing tests with Mocha and Chai, transitioning in JavaScript from ES5 to ES6 syntax while creating classes and methods to access data from several datasets, and using jQuery to append the data to the DOM. The project was additional practice in HTML and CSS. We also incorporated charts.js into our project. There was no comp provided.

## FitLit

FitLit simulates a health tracker. The site iterates through data to calculate various health metrics, goals, and comparisons for each user being accessed onload and their friends.

## To Check it out
1. Fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the Fork button.
1. Clone down the forked repo. Since you don't want to name your project "activity-tracker-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
1. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run npm install to install project dependencies.

### Issues
1. We would like to have additional hover buttons for each of the data bars on the left side of the page so that they present and respond in a similar fashion to the current graphs and buttons at the bottom of the page.
1. When we linted the project came accross some issues of variables not being defined that we need to look into further.
